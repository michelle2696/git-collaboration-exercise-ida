i look at you all see the love that's sleeping 
while my guitare gently weeps 
look at the fall and i see it needs sweeping 
still my guitare gently weeps
i dont know why nobody told you 
how to unfold your love 
i dont know how someone controlled you 
they bought and sold you 
i look at the world and i notice its turning 
while my guitare gently weeps 
every mistake we must surely be learning 
still my guitare gently weeps 
(eheh)

(guitare solo)

i dont know how you where diverted 
you where perverted too 
i dont know how you where inverted 
no one will let you 
i look at you all see the love that acts sleeping 
while my guitare gently weeps 
look (look) at you all 
still my guitare gently weeps 

(oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)
(oh oh oh ohohoh ohoh)
(yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah oh)
